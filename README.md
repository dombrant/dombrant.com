# dombrant.com

This is the code for my personal website [dombrant.com](https://dombrant.com). Currently I am evaluating a few different ideas to repurpose this website with a version 2.0 launch.

If you have any comments or feedback, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/dombrant/dombrant.com/issues).
